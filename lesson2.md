Lesson 2:  
As for lesson 2, I want to talk a little about similar words in English and Russian...  
Historically there are 3 possible ways of coming words into Russian:  
1. Indo-European language.  
This is the oldest possible way of words to be similar in English and Russian.  
Two words are likely to have similar meaning, if they are old enough and their consonants sequences are almost equal or there is shift from voiced consonants to voiceless (Proto-Germanic language shift)...  
Examples:  
milk = mlk = млк = молоко  
tree = tr(w) = дрв = дерево  
son = sn = сн = сын  
Maybe there are some other laws, but I don't know.  
2. Latin/Ancient Greek languages.  
Ancient Greek language has influenced Russian a lot as well as Latin language has influenced English.  
The words are likely to be this way similar, if they are specific terms and have same root. The suffixes and prefixes are usually different. For example, the most common suffix -tion is turning into -ция.  
Examples:  
procrastination = прокрастинация  
phraseological unit = фразеологизм  
cynicism = цинизм (person -> циник)  
philosophy = философия  
3. Just taking words from other languages..., especially French (18-19 century) and English (20-21 century).  
From French, words were usually taken by their sounding:  
parachute = парашют  
avenue = авеню  
wagon = вагон  
пальто = overcoat, greatcoat (French - paletot)  
From English there are two ways of taking:  
a) For 20-th century words -> how they are spelled :  
tram+way -> трамвай  
auto+bus -> автобус  
b) For 21-st century words -> how they are sound:  
business case -> бизнес кейс  
cringe -> кринж -> кринге (funny way of pronouncing based on how it is written)  
hype -> хайп
