Lesson 3:  
As for lesson 3 I would like to talk a little bit about morphological parsing/analysis...  
When you start memorizing new words for language, you are learning, you have two possible approaches. First approach - just memorize words as they are. This works perfect for languages like English and Japanese at least at starting levels, because they do not have a lot of words forms or language special forms are made from two consecutive words (phrasal verbs). Second approach - split word into parts and try guess its meaning based on the parts (morphological parsing). This will not work for every word in target language, of course, but, for sure, will make your life easier...  
(English language also has compound words. For example, international = inter + nation + -al; encounter = en + countre, enrich = en + rich; include = in + clude, exclude = ex + clude)  
Russian language has a lot of prefixes and suffixes. Some of them have analogs in English, some of them - not (or we do not know exactly what they are). I can not teach you all of them at once, and I won't even try. You will learn them from practice... For now, just remember to check morphological parsing of every russian word you meet. https://en.wiktionary.org will help you. For true morphological parsing of russian word you must find root (корень, indivisible and/or atomic), prefix-/es (приставка), suffix-/es (суффикс) and ending (окончание). If you are not sure then you can ask native speaker about them.  
For example, lets look at some verbs of motion: (you will curse Russian for their existence :))  
The basic verb we will take into consideration is "идти", which means "directional move to something on (by means of) your feet". Now we start making new word forms...  
"выйти" = "вы-" + "идти" in form "йти" = "out" + "go" = "to go out".  
"перейти" = "пере-" + "йти" = "over" + "go" = "to go over"/"to cross"/"to get across".  
"прийти" = "при-" + "йти" = "1. arrival form prefix" + "go" = "to come" (来る).  
"зайти" = "за-" + "йти". English does not have 1 to 1 analog. Basicly it means "to come into one place to go then to another". Something close to "to stop in"/"to drop in" based on google translate...  
"войти" = "во-(в-)" + "йти" = "the approximate meaning 'in' or 'into'" + "go" = "to enter"/"to go in"  
"пойти" = "по-" + "йти" = perfect (pf) form of "идти" (impf) = "will have gone". For now just remember that perfect form is equal perfect tense in English (present perfect -> past time form of perfect russian verb, future perfect -> present time form of perfect russian verb). More explanations will come later.  
"пройти" = "про-" + "йти" = "through, past" + "go" = "to go through, to pass by" = "(by going/moving) make something to be behind you".

I am tired.

-----
Hometask for lesson 3 (домашнее задание):  
Give explanations of the following words in terms of morphological parsing - "выкурить", "прикинуть" (hard), "переписать", "изписать" (hard), "врубить(ся)" (with -ся is hard), "пробежать", "износить", "каменщик", "маленький", "пароход", "пищеварение", "учитель".  
For verb "прикинуть" give today's meaning. Give explanation of -ся/-сь. Learn russian cognate word - "аналог" (analog), words collocation - "морфологический разбор" (morphological parsing/analysis).
