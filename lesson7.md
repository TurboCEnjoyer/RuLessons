Lesson 7.  
The last point is left in the table of Russian verbs conjugation is adverbial participles... (деепричастие/ия)  
We don't have analogs in English, as I know. The translation is differs based on is the verb is perfective of imperfective...  

-----
If the verb is imperfective, then you should translate this form as "while ..., I was doing something"...  
Скучая по Москве, он часто грустил темными зимними ночами. = Missing Moscow, he often felt sad on dark winter nights. (Google translate)  
While he was missing Moscow, he often feel sad on dark winter nights.  
Проводя эксперимент, он получили интересные результаты. = During the experiment, he got interesting results. (Google translate)  
While he was carrying out experiment, he got interesting results.  

-----
If the verb is perfective, then you should translate this form as "Having something done, ..."  
Сделав замеры, они отправились проверять их. = After taking measurements, they went to check them. (Google translate)  
Having done measurements, they went to check them.  
отправив запрос, он ожидал ответа 3 дня. = sending(?) a request, he waited a response for 3 days. (Google translate)  
Having sent a request, he waited a response for 3 days.  

-----
This form is hard, I think, but we use it often enough, especially in adverbial clause, which should always be separated with commas.  
Now, after 7 lessons, you should be able to detect verbs, participle and adverbial participles in texts, and also understand сonjugation for verbs on en.wiktionary.org. Do a practice, please.
