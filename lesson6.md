Lesson 6:  
In English we have 2 forms of participles - "-ing" form and "-ed/3 form".  
First we use, when subject do something by itself (film was interesting, the film give interest to me, active participles).  
Second we use, when subject is affected by something (I was bored, passive participles).  
In Russian participles are named "причастие/причастия". You can treat them as adjectives from verbs. They are pretty alike.

The first type English participles in Russian are named "действительные" (from existing/doing). They can be in 2 forms - present tense (like English -ing form) and past tense.  
(to flame)  
Пылать -> пылающий. (present tense, flaming)  
Пылать -> пылавший. (past tense, was flaming)  

---
The second type English participles in Russian are named "страдательные" (from to suffer, страдать). They also have 2 forms of present and past tense.  
(to solve)  
Решать -> решаемый (present tense, to be solved)  
Решать -> решённый (past tense, solved)

The last thing, I want to say, is that you can translate any English sentence with participle straightly. To do this you should replace "am/is/are" with verb "есть" in meaning "exist", "was/were" -"был", and use appropriate form of Russian participle:  
I am thinking.  
Я есть думающий.  
I was bored.  
Я был(а) скучавшим(ей).  
This is not a good translation, but you will be understood. Also some Russian verbs does not have active or passive participles, as it was in the last example. You can always check participle form of verb in wikidictionary...
