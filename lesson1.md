Lesson 1 (brief):  
1. Russian language is quite stable in pronunciation. If you know how the word is written in writing and where it is stressed, you can for sure read it (in comparing to English).
2. Russian pronunciation I think is more close to Japanese than to English.  
What letters are specific for Russian: (others exist in at least one of two languages)  
"ж" - it is Japanese ji (джи, dzhi), but you need to remove "d" sound in begining. In English it is written as "zh". Voiced sound "sh".  
"ц" - in English it is written as "ts". My japanese teacher have said, that you can hear something like this sound when you pronounce "tsukuru" as "tskuru" in native like manner...  
"щ" - is a very hard sound. Basically it is a combination of "s" + "ch" when you pronounce them quickly without articulation. In Japanese you can hear something like this sound in syllable "shi" when you doesn't pronounce "i" sound (shite as shte)  
"ы" - I can't teach you this sound. Only can give you good example:  
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vkg_M67ohS0  
In the first part she sings "pri(ы)g da skok, pri(ы)g da skok, povtori opyat' ". "ы" sound is perfect there. For the beginning, you can replace "ы" with "i" sound.  
"й" - sound is just beginning of sounds "ya" (я), yu (ю), ye (е) and yo (ё), and also you can hear it in japanese word "ii" when you pronounce second "i" very shortly.  
3. In Russian there is no short "i" (rip) and "u" (put) in basic set of sounds. Only long "i" (sheet) and "u" (moon). But sometimes you can find short "i" and "u" sounds in weak positions (not under stress).
4. Vowels in weak position (not under stress) can change their reading:  
о -> а -> ə  
е -> и (if it was not "ѣ" before soviet spelling reform)  
ё is always under stress  
э, у, ю, я, и, ы are quite stable  
5. Consonants are usually stable, but sometimes, in a sequence of several consonants, some of them may not be read (чу(в)ства, со(л)нце) or move, in according to their sounding, into other sounds (счастье -> щастье).
6. If you are not sure, how to read word, then read it as it is written without changing any sound (especially vowels).

Note:  
For now don't think about palatalization, just read syllable as two separate sounds. If you are interested in palatalization, you can check the photos in this article: http://www.philol.msu.ru/~kedr/h001444_manuscript.pdf. May be them can help you.
